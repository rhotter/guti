# Grand Unified Theory of Imaging

1. Motivation for the problem
- Why resolution is insufficient
- Scaling of modalities
- Each modality is so different, but we want a way to compare all of them
2. Abstracting each imaging model as a function from brain state to measurements
- Take an example of one of the modalities
3. What we’re trying to do with SVD — # of independent components
4. Channel capacity
- Note that this is just an upper bound
- Estimating noise levels
5. Example of gaussian blur
6. Results
- Scaling
7. Adding temporal dynamics (before we’ll just assume you have 1 time measurement)





## Motivation

Imagine you have a box and you want to know what's inside. How do you quantify how much information you get about its contents?
When people think of imaging methods like MRI, they tend to think of their quality in terms of spatial resolution. However, that is not a complete description.
For one, the resolution means nothing if the signal is too noisy. Sometimes, the resolution changes with depth. Sometimes, the information you get requires complicated assumption-heavy reconstruction to get to a volumetric picture.

But there is a way to determine the maximal amount of information you get about the contents of the box without making assumptions about the reconstruction.

~~transition from box to brain? do we need the box?~~
What you really care about when doing brain imaging is how many independent dimensions of imaging you get, and what their signal-to-noise ratio is.
