# Grand Unified Theory of Imaging

1. Motivation for the problem
- Why resolution is insufficient
- Scaling of modalities (should david invest in meg)
- Each modality is so different, but we want a way to compare all of them
2. Abstracting each imaging model as a function from brain state to measurements
- Take an example of one of the modalities
3. What we’re trying to do with SVD — # of independent components
4. Channel capacity
- Note that this is just an upper bound
- Estimating noise levels
5. Example of gaussian blur
6. Results
- Scaling
7. Adding temporal dynamics (before we’ll just assume you have 1 time measurement
